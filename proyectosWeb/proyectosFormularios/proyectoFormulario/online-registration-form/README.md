# Information regarding this project repository

## Goals
  The goal of this project is to display a solid understanding of how forms should be structured, how they operate, and how to handle basic HTML5 form validation. I went a little further and also improved the Web Accessibility Compliance as well as adding additional features. I utilized a Fluid Mobile First approach to designing this so as to maximize not only cross browser compatibility but also cross platform compatibility as well.

## Description
  A _Mobile-First Responsive_ registration form. Incorporated various html input types and associated attributes for form control. Form implements html5 form validations such as **_required_** and simple valid email check. Form is **WCAG** compliant passing Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse audits and utilizes semantic markup for the architecture of the html. The form also includes an elegant "blur-in" animation for the sake of presentation purposes.

  **NOTE:** _The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript._

  _In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails._
